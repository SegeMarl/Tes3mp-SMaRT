# Tes3mp-SMaRT
The Elder Scroll 3 Multiplayer - Server Monitor and Rebooting Tool

You can use this batch file to automate the restarting and backing up of your Tes3mp server.

  During first launch it has a helpful setup will allow you enable several features including:

  Logging (creates a log file with the status of the server and will restart in the case of a crash)

  Server Reboot (Can reboot the 1 to 4 times a day at specified times)

  Character backup (all jsons are copied with timestamps for ease of data recovery)

  Cell Backup (save up to 10 seperate json to protect against griefing or automatic deletion from server scripts. Individual cells will need to be added by editing the settings.txt, and more than 10 cells can be added by copying line 165 in the .bat and increasing the count.)

Both the batch and settings files have plenty of documentation to make them as user friendly as possible, but feel free to reach out if there's any issues with the program.
